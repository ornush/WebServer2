 # WebServer Project 



In This Project we have created RESTFUL API server that wil connect to our ClientChat Web App from the last project that call "WebClient".<br />

The arguments that you'll need to enter for login will be the same as the last project.<br />

The uniqueness of this project is that we can control on the static Web App with new server that can make the App to be Dynamic as it should.<br />

In the chat you can interact and send only text masseges but onle via the server API requests.<br />

After you download all the files you can run the App on Your broswer  <br />

<ins>**if you want to Register**<br />
you will need to enter the names from tha array below:
1. User Name (should include 4 Characters)<br />
 
 users = [<br />

  Id = 1, Name = "bobby", Server = "localhost:7266", Last = "i know what you did last summer", LastDate = 22 <br />
  Id = 2, Name = "alice", Server = "localhost7266", Last = "hi how are you", LastDate = 33 <br />
 

<ins>**for each action that you'll want to make there is an API request that sends the request from the server directly to the broswer**<br />
<ins>**few examples:


## -----we have used POSTMAN APP and we recommand to use it too as well<br />

for the  -/api/contacts - you'll get all the users list  ///GET<br />
